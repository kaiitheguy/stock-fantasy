# Stock Fantasy 📈

Stock Fantasy is a mobile app that gamifies stock picking using a Tinder-like swipe interface. Weekly stock recommendations are generated by an LLM (Gemini or OpenAI), and real-time market data is fetched from Yahoo Finance.



## Core Technologies

* **Frontend**: React Native (Expo)
* **Backend**: Python (FastAPI)
* **LLM Integration**: OpenAI & Google Gemini
* **Live Data**: Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)

---

## Architecture Overview

This project uses a **client-server architecture**:

* **Backend (Python/FastAPI)**: A server that handles all the heavy lifting. It calls the LLM to generate weekly stock picks, caches them, and fetches live daily price data from Yahoo Finance when requested.
* **Frontend (React Native)**: A mobile app that provides the user interface. It is responsible for displaying the data and capturing user swipes. It makes network requests to the backend to get the stock data.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (LTS version) and npm
* [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and pip
* The **Expo Go** app on your iOS or Android device.

### 1. Backend Setup

First, set up and run the Python server.

```bash
# Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project-directory>

# Create and activate a Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create the environment file for your API keys
touch .env
```

Now, open the newly created `.env` file and add your API keys:

```env
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

Next, set up the React Native mobile app.

```bash
# In the same project directory, install the Node.js dependencies
npm install

# IMPORTANT: Configure the API URL
```

Open the `App.tsx` file and find the `API_URL` constant. **You must change the placeholder IP address to your computer's local IP address.**

```typescript
// In App.tsx
const API_URL = '[http://192.168.1.10:8000/daily-stock-data](http://192.168.1.10:8000/daily-stock-data)'; // <-- CHANGE THIS IP
```

## ▶️ Running the Application

To run the full application, you will need **three separate terminal windows**.

#### **Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server** 👨‍🍳

This terminal runs your Python API. It must be left running.

```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is activated
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

#### **Terminal 2: Start the Frontend App** 🧍

This terminal runs the React Native Metro server, which serves your app's code.

```bash
npm run start
```
This will display a QR code.

#### **Terminal 3: Generate the Initial Data** 🧑‍💼

This terminal is used to send a one-time command to your running backend to generate the weekly stock list.

```bash
# This calls the LLM and populates the in-memory cache
curl [http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate-weekly-stocks](http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate-weekly-stocks)
```

#### **Final Step: Open the App**

Scan the QR code from Terminal 2 with the **Expo Go** app on your phone. The app will load, fetch the data from your local backend server, and display the cards.
